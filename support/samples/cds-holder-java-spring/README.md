# Based on OpenAPI generated server

Spring Boot Server 


## Overview  
This server was generated by the [OpenAPI Generator](https://openapi-generator.tech) project.

Then we have added OR Mapping and JPA support with H2 as database, in order to demonstrate 
an end-to-end implementation of the API endpoints.

We have also added HTTP header processing according to [the HTTP header spec](https://consumerdatastandardsaustralia.github.io/standards/#http-headers)
